## Description

Final project for CS 546. Team members include Shiddharath Patel, Aidan Ryan, Adam Woo, and Sejad Kiyam. We implemented a dashboard for landlords and tenants. Landlords are able to view information on tenants such as work orders and payments. Tenants are able to create this data through their own dashboard.
